    My second project - the Score Keeper App is made to be more like a game rather than just a counter. It might not be the most advanced of my apps but it has been my first milestone and gave me lots of motivation to work harder therefore I have showcased it here.

  5th Project for Udacity. It's a simple tour guide app of Bologna: in the 4 tabs it shows different activities to be done in the town. 
  The last tab provides easy sentences to be heard in the local dialect. 
  It's not the most advanced project I made, but the most rewarding for me and the funniest to do!
